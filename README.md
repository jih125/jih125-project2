## INFSCI2560 Project2

### ← What framework did you pick and why?

I used Vue.js framework for this project because I have a little bit of experience of working via Vue.js for courses from previous terms and it will be better to get more self practice on Vue.js.

### ← What about that framework appealed to you, for this project?

Since I have learned some quite basic knowledge about Vue.js before, I know that the Vue.js is quick and fast for developers to build small and light website project. Generally a Vue project is similar as the normal html framework which contains html,js and css files. We can also combine them within a single vue file which uses 
### ← What alternative frameworks did you consider?

Another framework I might consider is React. The React.js is bigger than Vue.js but it also has more powerful performance and community support than Vue.js. I would consider to use React for the next time.

### ← What resources did you read/watch/listen to?

The official document, online community such as Stack Overflow and the doc from Element-UI component library which provides detailed description which tells how to utilize their Vue components.

### ← Describe your project. What does it do? What components or features of the framework did you explore for this project?

The project is about a simple student status form with an editable table which shows some default student data. I deployed diverse input settings including switch, radio group, datepicker, select and the default text input. All of them are avalaible to show on the table. Now The data can be removed from the table, and I'm still thinking of how to make them editable that return the table data to the form.
All the components are imported from Element-UI, which provides UI component for Vue, React and Angular. I always want to use them in Glitch, and the current solution is import the CDN for both the Vue and Element UI. I hope that to be allowable because I really want to make my project visually fancier than those using simple css settings.
